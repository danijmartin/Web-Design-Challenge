# Web-Design-Challenge  

In this challenge I used the data and plots from the Python-API challenge to build a responsive Visualizations website.  

This website consists of 7 pages:  
* Landing page: includes project summary and visualization previews.  
* 4 visualization pages: Each contains a plot with description as well as previews for all visualizations.  
* Comparisons page: A larger version of the visualization preview sidebar mentioned above. This allows for easy comparison of the plots.  
* Data page: the complete data for the project is included as well for anyone that wishes to take a closer look.  

The website can be found here:
